# mammogram mass detection
<div> 
This project focuses on detecting the mass for mammogram based on Mask RCNN models using CBIS-DDSM dataset. Considering the small size of dataset, we preprocess it carefully and generate clean data using opencv and scikit. Finally, we use Mask-RCNN pretrained on balloon dataset to train based on detectron2.

## preprocess 
The preprocess includes removing artifact, removing pectoral and adding black border based on opencv and scikit. Some outcomes are showed below. (The figures of outcome)

  <summary>usage</summary>
  1. adjust your directory like this: <br />
  |--CBIS-DDSM <br />
  |&emsp  |--mass_train <br />
  |&emsp &emsp    |--mass_train <br />
  | &emsp  |--mass_test <br />
  |  &emsp &emsp   |--mass_test<br />
  2. upload the image_process.py <br />
  3. adjust the original directory of CBIS-DDSM and run it

### preprocess test
Here are some test results and if you want to see more, you can read from the direcotry of /preprocess/preprocess_test_result

## something to improve
1. CBIS-DDSM is not completely used and this experiment just use about 1200 mass train dataset and about 360 mass test datasets.
2. The quality of medical images are not stable so some pictures can not be preprocessed well while some others can.
3. The procedure of preprocessing also generates noise of images which can be seen obviously through artifact_mask.jpg


## other
1. I would appreciate it very much if you could give me a star.‚ù§Ô∏è
2. Improvements are encouraged and I am expected to that.üåà
